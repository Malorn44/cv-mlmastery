Machine Learning Mastery: Deep Learning for Computer Vision

The purpose of this repository is to improve my skills with Computer Vision using Deep Learning techniques and OpenCV. The specific course I am following for this repository is Machine Learning Mastery's Deep Learning for Computer Vision. The course is conducted in Python but I also want to learn how to implement solutions in C/C++ so I will be revisiting this course after completing it in Python to implement in C/C++.
